## **Flutter Learning Roadmap for a Serious Project**  

### **ðŸ“Œ Week 1-2: Flutter & Dart Fundamentals**  
âœ… Install Flutter & set up development environment

âœ… Understand Flutter's widget tree (Stateless & Stateful widgets)  
âœ… Layout system (Row, Column, Stack, ListView, GridView, Expanded, Flex)  
âœ… Navigation & routing (`Navigator`, `go_router`)

### **ðŸ“Œ Week 3-4: State Management & API Integration**  
âœ… Learn state management (choose one: `Provider`, `Riverpod`, `Bloc`)  
âœ… Fetch & display data using `http` or `Dio`  
âœ… Local storage solutions (`Hive`, `SharedPreferences`, `SQLite`)  
âœ… Error handling & debugging (Flutter DevTools, logs)

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Month 3: Optimization & Production Readiness**  
âœ… Write unit & widget tests (`flutter_test`, `mockito`)  
âœ… Optimize performance (reduce rebuilds, lazy loading, profiling)  
âœ… Implement deep linking & push notifications  
âœ… Integrate payments (`Stripe`, `Google Pay`, `Apple Pay`)  
âœ… CI/CD for automated builds & deployments (`Codemagic`, `GitHub Actions`)

### **Final Step: Start a Serious Project ðŸš€**  
By this point, you'll be ready to build a production-level Flutter app. If you have a specific project in mind, let me know, and I can tailor this list further! ðŸŽ¯
